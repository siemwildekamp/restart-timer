Server Restart Plugin

Overview

The Server Restart plugin adds a simple command, /server-restart, to Minecraft servers. When executed, it starts a 60-second countdown, notifying players that the server will restart in 60 seconds. After the countdown, the server automatically restarts, making it easier for administrators to handle scheduled or manual restarts without extra tools or complex setups.
